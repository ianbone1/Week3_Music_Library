# BAD NEWS G11!

John's got TOO MANY RECORDS! :minidisc:

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a him to manage his sizeable collection. Johan would like his Music Manager:tm: to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists
* Create and Save Albums
* List All Artists/Albums

* List all the albums he has by an artist
* Show the artist any album belongs to

Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

Once those are done John would like it if he could do the following as well:

* Edit Artists/Albums
* Delete Artists/Albums
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID
